# G4CatchAll

I converted the python code which  was developed by Osman DOLUCA to PHP language to make it run on the web. Thr purpose of this project is to 
"Capture putative G-quadruplexes hidden in DNA/RNA sequences. G4Catchall gives you the option to search for not just typical G-quadruplexes but also "imperfect" G-quadruplexes with less than desirable features.
You can also choose the maximum number of atypical G-tracts and an extreme loop as well as the apply seperate rules for unstable, two-G-tetrad, vs stable G-quadruplexes." (taken from http://homes.ieu.edu.tr/odoluca/Tools.html)

The website I developed for this project --> http://homes.ieu.edu.tr/odoluca/G4Catchall/ 

This work was supported by TUBITAK, project no 216S854.
